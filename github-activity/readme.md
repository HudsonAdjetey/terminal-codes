# GitHub User Activity CLI

This project is part of the Backend Developer Roadmap on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). The GitHub User Activity CLI allows you to fetch and display recent activity from any GitHub user by interacting with the GitHub API.

## Project Page

You can view the project page for this solution on roadmap.sh: [GitHub User Activity Project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity).

## Features

- Fetches recent GitHub user activity using the GitHub API.
- Displays actions like issues created, pushes made, branches created, and repositories watched.
- Handles errors gracefully when no activities are found or an invalid username is provided.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd github-user-activity
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```

4. Make the CLI executable (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   chmod +x github-activity.js
   ```

## Usage

To run the CLI, use the following command, passing in the GitHub username as an argument:

```bash
./github-activity.js <github-username>
```

Or if running directly with Node.js:

```bash
node github-activity.js <github-username>
```

### Example

```bash
node github-activity.js hudsonAdjetey
```

This command will fetch and display the recent activity of the GitHub user `kamranahmedse`.

### Example Output

```bash
Recent activity for the user: kamranahmedse
Git Actions: -pushed to the repo HudsonAdjetey/Pern-chat - commit(s) -> 3
Git Actions: -created a new repo HudsonAdjetey/components
Git Actions: -watched the repo HudsonAdjetey/components
```

## Error Handling

If no activity is found for the user or an invalid username is provided, the output will display:

```bash
No GitHub events found for this user.
```

In case of an API failure, it will display an error message:

```bash
Error fetching GitHub events: <error message>
```
